1. Add custom buff Ablative Barrier
2. In "Changes" add +2 Armor AC

4. Give it Limited uses Charges, set Charge cost formula to 0 and Maximum Uses Formula to (@item.level*5)
5. In "Advanced" add two scripts, useAblativeBarrier in "Use" and setAblativeBarrier in "Toggle"
6. When player is taking damage, one must activate this buff and type the amount of damage taken. The code will do the rest. The buff will automatically deactivate once the charges are off.
